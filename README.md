DATABASE DESIGN

We designed a database called Vidzy. We created four collections which include accounts, cart, 
cart history and the items collection. The accounts collection has the data of the user which 
includes username, the password where it is hashed. The cart collection has the data of the 
product that has been added into the cart by the currently logged in user. The Cart history has 
the data of the product that has been ordered by the currently logged in user. The Items 
collection has the data of the product that includes the title, price, the quantity of the product 
in the stock, the category and the image name
